Terraform Learnings 

## Welcome to my Terraform Learnings Repository! ðŸš€

In this repository, I document my journey and progress in learning Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp. I have been exploring various aspects of Terraform to automate and manage infrastructure resources on different cloud platforms.

## Contents:

1. Terraform Basics: Learned fundamental concepts, installation instructions, and getting-started guides for setting up a local development environment.
2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Patterns for writing maintainable and efficient Terraform code.
3. Cloud Providers: Sample Terraform configurations for different cloud providers "AWS".
4. Modules and Reusability: Created Terraform modules to organize code and promote modularity.
5. Terraform State Management: Explored various state storage options, state locking, and techniques for collaborating in a team environment.
7. Advanced Terraform Features: Delved into advanced features, such as remote backends.

I'm open to feedback and contributions, so feel free to raise issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸŒ±
